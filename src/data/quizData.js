    question: "What determines the loudness of a sound wave?",
    options: ["Frequency", "Amplitude", "Wavelength", "Speed"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Amplitude determines the loudness - larger amplitude means louder sound!",
  },
  {
    question: "What determines the pitch of a sound wave?",
    options: ["Amplitude", "Speed", "Frequency", "Medium"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Frequency determines pitch - higher frequency means higher pitch!",
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of wave needs a medium to travel?",
    options: ["Light waves", "Radio waves", "Sound waves", "X-rays"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Sound waves are mechanical waves that need a medium like air or water to travel!",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the relationship between wavelength and frequency?",
    options: [
      "Directly proportional",
      "Inversely proportional",
      "No relationship",
      "Exponentially related",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional - as frequency increases, wavelength decreases!",
  },
  {
    question: "Which waves can travel through vacuum?",
    options: [
      "Sound waves",
      "Water waves",
      "Electromagnetic waves",
      "Seismic waves",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Electromagnetic waves like light can travel through vacuum, unlike mechanical waves!",
  },
